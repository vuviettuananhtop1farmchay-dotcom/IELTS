Many believe that the best way to ensure a happier society is to reduce the difference between in income earnings between the rich and poor
  I agree.Because if making the gap between rich and poor smaller, it can help people feel happier, feels fairer and less stressful.
 When everyone has a more equal income, people feel more happy and can help each other. because everyone is equal, there 's no war, so people 
 can live longer and happier. However, happiness also comes from things like good health,freedom and education.
 So, income equality is helpful, but it is not the only factor that makes all of us happy.

12/1: 
people shoould plant more trees in open spaces in towns and cities
-> open spaces in towns and cities should be decorated with more trees
because trees clean the air -> cleaning the air is considered to be main reason
for example, TB has more trees than HN -> HN is seen to have fewer trees than TB
So TB has fresher air than HN ->  fresher air is enjoyed by TB people

Many poeple believe that open spaces in towns and cities should be decorated with more trees along the streets.
As a matter of fact, cleaning the air is considered to be main reason why trees are so valuable. for example, HN is seen to have fewer trees than TB.
fresher air is enjoyed by TB people.

It is bad for people to put their personal infromation online for purposes such as signing up for social networks or online banking
->  personal information is bad to be put on syber space for purposes such as registering for social networks or online banking

Because it is not safe
-> security is not outdated/ defended/ advanced enough

SHOULD THE SCHOOL TEACH CHILRDEN PRATICAL SKILLS OR JUST ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE?
  Schools should also teach practical skills such as money management, communication, and basic life skills for daily living.
  Practical skills help students become independent and confident in real-life situations.
  Learning both academic and practical skills helps students be better prepared for future jobs.
  Therefore, schools should teach both academic knowledge and practical skills to give students a balanced education.
