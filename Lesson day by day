1.what is this?
  It stands for:
        clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
  it is a gene-editing technology that allows scientist to:
          precisely cut DNA
          remove or disable genes, or 
          insert new genetic information 
origin: 
It was discovered in bacteria , which use it as a natural defense system to protect themselves from viruses. Scientist adapted this system into a powerful tool for editing genes in plants animals and humans

8/12 : we live in a simulation theory
1.what is this?
      it suggest that everything we see touch, feel , and experience might not be the "real world", but a computer -generated simulation created by an advanced civilization 
   this idea isn't new.many philosophers throughout history have asked similar questions

1.ancient roots of the idea 
 plato- allegory of the cave : 
       -people live chained inside a cave
       - they only see shadows on a wall
       - they believed the shadow are reality 
       - in truth, the shadows are just projections from objects behind them

15/12: Gender roles
 1.what is this?
   it referes to the social constructed expectations about how indivisuals should behave, think, and act based on their gender
   these roles are shaped by culture, traditors, religion, education , and history, rather than biology alone
---Traditionally, societies assigned different responsabilities to men and women , oftne linking gender to specific ,duties, occurpation and behaviors
 -----simple explanation: are the rules society creates

  ACIENT EGYPT - stability through control 
acient egypt, one of the first long-lasting civilizations
egypt's power came from geography, 
Many believe that the best way to ensure a happier society is to reduce the difference between in income earnings between the rich and poor
  I agree.Because if making the gap between rich and poor smaller, it can help people feel happier, feels fairer and less stressful.
 When everyone has a more equal income, people feel more happy and can help each other. because everyone is equal, there 's no war, so people 
 can live longer and happier. However, happiness also comes from things like good health,freedom and education.
 So, income equality is helpful, but it is not the only factor that makes all of us happy.

12/1: 
people shoould plant more trees in open spaces in towns and cities
-> open spaces in towns and cities should be decorated with more trees
because trees clean the air -> cleaning the air is considered to be main reason
for example, TB has more trees than HN -> HN is seen to have fewer trees than TB
So TB has fresher air than HN ->  fresher air is enjoyed by TB people

Many poeple believe that open spaces in towns and cities should be decorated with more trees along the streets.
As a matter of fact, cleaning the air is considered to be main reason why trees are so valuable. for example, HN is seen to have fewer trees than TB.
fresher air is enjoyed by TB people.

It is bad for people to put their personal infromation online for purposes such as signing up for social networks or online banking
->  personal information is bad to be put on syber space for purposes such as registering for social networks or online banking
->  personal information should not be put ........
Because it is not safe
-> security is not outdated/ defended/ advanced enough 
so personal information can be used for bad purposes
->  so personal information would/ can be put in danger/ stolen/ attacked/ leaked/ breached 
for example , we can lose a lot of money because hacker can steal our information and take our money from the bank
->  money from the bank can be hacked as our private data can be stolen by hackers/ threat actors
so we should not put our personal information online
-> the internet/cyber space is not a ladnscape our personal information should be made available.

doan 4: USE TO erope
startled by the bright silken banners -> run in public
Yet, within decades Chinese silks were widely worn <-- the rich and noble families of Rome.
The Roman Emperor Heliogabalus (218-222 AD) wore nothing but silk : romane emperor
which was oneconfined to the nobility, has now spread to all classes without distinction --> everyone has silk
The desire for silk
war -> roman soldier scared of white banners -> fled                  <----
-> decades , emperor wore silk -> rich ppl -> everyone -> desire for silk/ \

doan 5 : 
silk production -> korea
cultivation of the silkworm --> india

doan 6 : silk go to middle east
-->two monks : high silkworm egg in bamboo walking sticks
-->started to make silk -->  church and state monopol --> cheaper normal silk than chines 
undercutting : cheaper than price
. But higher quality still expensive in the west  --> persian --> italy --> all europe

doan 7: 
world production *2. china * japan--> 1970, only china

NEW WORLD
undercut a market = sell at a lower  price 
 approximately = a lower or a bit 
fled = run away 
panic = fear


LESSON: 
1. would i let my kids run around the neighborhood unsupervised? : don't care
2. would i trust the education system wholeheartedly? 
3. would i tell my kids that hard works guarantees a stable life?
4.would i let my kid develop common sense with friends - or force traditional common sense early?
                             (the sun is yellow)
core philosophy : main idea
roam = run 
SHOULD THE SCHOOL TEACH CHILRDEN PRATICAL SKILLS OR JUST ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE?
  Schools should also teach practical skills such as money management, communication, and basic life skills for daily living.
  Practical skills help students become independent and confident in real-life situations.
  Learning both academic and practical skills helps students be better prepared for future jobs.
  Therefore, schools should teach both academic knowledge and practical skills to give students a balanced education.

19/1 : history of high tech

TEST 2: The Clipper Races: an era of competition between cargo ships
------During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the British East India Company had the monopoly on trade with China and India. This meant that because no rival could legally import tea or other goods from these countries at this time, the company was rarely in a hurry to transport its merchandise. Instead, its priority was to minimise costs by carrying as much as possible on each ship. This meant that its ships - known as East lndiamen - were enormous, strong and very slow.
     (East india company :monopoly: china and india-> no rival-> no need to be fast-> minimize cost )
------By 1800, the average East lndiaman could carry 1,200 tons of merchandise. The trading pattern for China tea usually meant the East lndiamen set sail from Britain in January, sailed round the Cape of Good Hope at the southernmost tip of Africa, and arrived in China in September. There they would load up that year's tea harvest, set off again and, depending on the wind and weather, aim to arrive back by the following September. So even with favourable sailing conditions, the round trip lasted almost two years, and if anything went wrong it could take a lot longer.
      trip 2 Years : jan:britain-> sep:china->next sep:britain(wind and weather) 
------However, by 1834 the company had lost its trading monopolies, and tea had become a freely traded item. Having no more use for its great ships, the company sold them off, and many were bought by merchants or their captains, who continued to plough the seas between Britain and China. But now that tea could be traded freely, a few smart sailors began to realise that whoever brought each new harvest of tea to Britain first, stood to make the most money.
      loss of monopoly-> EIC sold big ships-> captain + merchans-> fast->
------This was partly because if you were home first, you could sell your shipment of tea before your competitors even arrived, and partly because consumers in Britain in the nineteenth century believed that the fresher and earlier-picked the tea, the better the resulting drink. Tea traders now needed faster, sleeker ships to bring their precious cargo back. Nevertheless, in Britain this idea only caught on slowly, and while the 1840s saw a few faster ships launched, for the time being many merchants remained satisfied with the slow but reliable East lndiamen.
      opportunities<- british though that earlier picked/ fresher tea=better drink-> faster. But idea caught on slow-> still use EIC
------In fact it was the Americans who pioneered the first clipper ships. These vessels were fast and slender, with a narrow hull that was deeper at the back than at the front and masses of sails on tall masts. They earned their name from the way that they clipped off journey times British merchants resolved to build their own clippers to rival the Americans and the first British tea clipper, Stornaway, was built in Aberdeen in 1850 More tea clippers were designed and built in Britain throughout the 1850s and 1860s, they had a narrower beam than their American equivalents, making them less powerful during storms, but faster in calmer weather.
       clipper: smaller ships…..:in America-> britain( stornaway); less power in storm , faster in calm
------There was a great spirit of competition between the British and American ships plying the tea trade, but to begin with the Americans had the edge. Then in 1851 a British ship owner, Richard Green, built the aptly named clipper Challenger, with the stated intention of beating the American ships. Loaded with tea, Challenger left China for London in 1852 at the same time as the American clipper Challenge, a much larger, older ship, already greatly admired for its speed. Large sums were bet on which would complete the journey first. In the event, the British ship beat its rival to London by two days, amid much jubilation. From then on, such international races grew in popularity.
       competition: at the beginning American-> bristish : challenger-> challenger vs challenge ->( older larger)-> challenger : 2 days
 ------After 1855, American participation in the British tea trade gradually stopped. But even without the Anglo-American rivalry, the competitive spirit continued. It was really ignited when new ports were opened up for trade in China. These included Fouchow, which was much closer to the tea-producing areas than Canton, the port used previously. As a result, tea could be loaded onboard earlier and fresher, and the clippers could set off in late May or early June - sometimes not even taking time to fill out the official paperwork - racing back to Britain whatever the difficulties.
       after 1855< no more American-> competition still continue-> new port Fouchou( old port: caunton)-. Load faster and fresher( smtime no official paper work)
 -------They sped down through the South China Sea and into the Indian Ocean, then raced to get round the southernmost tip of Africa at the Cape of Good Hope. Then it was north across the vast Atlantic, past the Azores, through the English Channel and into the estuary of the River Thames. Once there, they would be towed by tugs, up the river and into the docks.
       New group: south china sea-> oidian ocean->cape of good hope ( Africa)-> atlantic-> river thames-. Town by tugs into ducksNew group: south china sea-> oidian ocean->cape of good hope ( Africa)-> atlantic-> river thames-. Town by tugs into ducks
 -------The cargo of the winning ship could earn a premium of up to sixpence per pound-and so the captain and crew were rewarded by the owners of the cargo. But the races were about more than just money the crews, about 40 men on each clipper, were expert sailors, proud of their ships, and they delighted in competing against each other. Without their enthusiasm, the races would never have happened, since getting the ship home as fast as possible required the crew to be totally dedicated and to sacrifice much of their rest for the duration of the race. 
        cargo of winning ship: sixpence per pound, > competition was more than just money

26/1: venezuela
1. What Happened (Confirmed Developments in the first 3 days of 2026)
• U.S. forces conducted a large-scale military operation in Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The raid involved elite U.S. special forces and airstrikes targeting Venezuelan military sites. 
• Maduro and Flores were flown to the United States and appeared in federal court in New York on charges including narco-terrorism and cocaine trafficking, part of a superseding indictment unsealed after their capture. 
• The U.S. government has indicated it may maintain influence over Venezuelan policy and secure access to Venezuela’s vast oil resources. 
• The legality of the operation is under intense international scrutiny; critics including the UN Secretary-General describe it as setting a dangerous precedent under international law. 
• Allies of Venezuela such as China have condemned the action as “unilateral bullying” and a violation of sovereignty. 
• Switzerland has frozen assets linked to Maduro and associates in response to the arrests. 

central banking mechanisms and sovereignty arrangements :
airstrikes: special use in fighting
target : focus on
federal court : a court is a room where people talk and talk who is right who is wrong 
                federal means national
indictment: a paper say you are wrong
unsealed : open
scrutiny: nagative feedback
condemned : confirm you 're wrong
sovereignty. : freedom of the country
precedent : st that happen before / example from the past

WRITING: 
   step 1:  Effect on pepople living in cities: 
-more ppl --> increase house price --> no house to live
-expensive education , hospitals -> bad health 

  step 2: There are 2 mains effects on pppl living in these cites. firstly . more ppl will lead to an increase in house price. when that happens, ppl will have no house to lie in
secondly, education in these cities is very expensive. also hospitals are also expensive , so ppl have bad health

 step3: fix 
  2 big effects on ppl who live in those cities are seen often 
firstly , if more ppl go to big cities the price of houses will increase
ppl who don't have enough money will have no house to live in 
secondly, educcation in these cities is often considered very expensive
also, hospitals which are very expensive can make poor ppl have bad health

step 4: paraphrase
  2 detrimental impacts on city drewlers are more than often observed. 
firstly, were the number of immigrantsto increase housing market would respond with huge swing to te uptside
as a consequence, those who are less fortunated will have no choice but to be homeless or live without permanent accommodation
secondly, education in such rural ares is often deemed to be out of reach = impossible  = beyond the budget for the majority of the population 
furthermore, hospitals which are usually too costly can become a great barrier between the poor and good health care

-------What can be done to maintain the quality of life of people?
1.idea: 
- decrease living cost -> cheaper house for ppl to buy
- move hospital /university to smaller cities -> ppl move there -> fewer ppl -> less expensive
- control birthrates -> fewer babies-> fewer ppl -> less expensive

The cost of living can be reduced if cheaper houses, which are more affordable for people, are provided.
Hospitals and universities, which are usually built in big cities, should be moved to smaller cities if population pressure is to be reduced.
If public facilities are relocated, people will be encouraged to move, which will result in fewer residents and lower living costs.
If birth rates are controlled, fewer babies will be born, which will lead to a smaller population and lower expenses.

==> The quality of life can be improved if the cost of living is reduced, which can be done if cheaper houses, which are affordable for people, are provided
    Hospitals and universities, which are often built in big cities, should be moved to smaller cities if overcrowding is to be reduced
    If these facilities are relocated, people will be encouraged to move, which will lead to fewer residents and lower living costs
    Finally, birth rates should be controlled if population growth is to be limited, and if fewer babies are born, living expenses can be kept stable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29/1: International information
 1. Why International Organizations Exist at All
International organizations emerged primarily after World War II, when global leaders concluded that uncoordinated nation-states competing economically and militarily had twice destroyed the world, and that some form of permanent cooperation was necessary to reduce conflict, manage trade, stabilize health crises, and rebuild trust.
The core assumption behind these institutions was simple but ambitious:
If countries talk regularly, share rules, and cooperate through institutions, they will be less likely to fight.
However, these organizations were built by states with unequal power, meaning their rules, funding, and enforcement mechanisms often reflected the interests of the strongest members rather than neutral global needs.

3. World Trade Organization (WTO)
History
The WTO was established in 1995, evolving from the post-war General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), with the goal of preventing the protectionist trade wars that contributed to the Great Depression and World War II.
Mission
The WTO aims to promote free trade, reduce tariffs, and provide a rules-based system to resolve trade disputes peacefully rather than through retaliation or war.
What WTO Did Right
• Lowered global tariffs/ import tax 
• Expanded international trade but in wto
• Provided dispute-settlement mechanisms
• Integrated developing economies into global markets
For decades, global trade growth coincided with reduced interstate war.
Major Mistakes and Failures
The WTO assumed that free trade benefits would be evenly distributed, which proved false.

Critics argue it:
• accelerated deindustrialization in some countries very fast - big country  
• weakened labor protections
• struggled to adapt to digital trade and state capitalism
• became paralyzed as major powers ignored rulings

Structural problem:
The WTO has rules, but no real power to enforce them against strong states.
Lesson:
Rules without enforcement work only while everyone believes in them.

WRITING: even though globalization has some very positives effect, we can't forget it negative effect. what are the disadvvantages and advantages of global
globalization has been a topic of discussion for many years. while some people think it brings many benefits such as economic,  and a few drawbacks such as . i believe that globalization brings both benefits and drawbacks that need to be carefully considered. 
Globalization brings many advantages, which help countries develop economically. More jobs are created, and modern technology is shared among nations, which improves people’s quality of life. If globalization is well controlled, international cooperation will be strengthened and living standards will be raised.
However, globalization also has disadvantages. Local cultures, which are closely connected to national identity, may be lost, and the environment can be seriously damaged. If strict laws are not enforced, natural resources will be overused and pollution will be increased.
In conclusion, some may consider globalization to be beneficial because  it promotes economic growth and cultural. However, i am inclined to support the idea that it causes more disadvantages Because when it was established, globalization was making our humanities wore and worse

5/2: Writing task 1
the given line chart depicts different causes of contaminant from 1990 to 2005 in the UK
Overall, air pollution such as households and industry tended to decrease significantly. Meanwhile, population from transport had an up trend.
Especially, in 1990, total air pollutants peaked at approximately 7 million tonnes.

Regarding industrial pollution, a clear downward trend can be seen. In 1990, emissions stood at approximately 7 million tonnes, before declining steadily over the period to about 3 million tonnes in 2005.
Meanwhile, pollution from transport increased slightly at first before decreasing towards the end of the period. 
In contrast, household emissions remained relatively low throughout, finishing at under 2 million tonnes.

Writing:
The line graph illustrates changes in the weekly consumption of four types of meat and fish in a European country between 1979 and 2004, measured in grams per person.

Overall, chicken consumption rose steadily to become the most popular by the end of the period, while beef and lamb showed clear downward trends. 
Fish, by contrast, remained the least consumed food throughout and declined only slightly.

At the beginning, beef was the most widely eaten meat at just over 200 grams per person per week, despite some fluctuations in the early 1980s. However, its consumption fell markedly after the late 1980s, dropping to a little above 100 grams by 2004. 
Lamb followed a similar but less dramatic pattern, decreasing from around 150 grams at the start to roughly 60 grams at the end.

In contrast, chicken intake increased consistently over the 25-year period. Starting at about 150 grams per week, it overtook beef around 1990 and continued to rise, reaching approximately 250 grams by 2004. 
Fish consumption was much lower throughout, beginning at around 60 grams and gradually declining to just over 40 grams per person per week.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quest 1:
The line graph illustrates the proportions of four types of household waste that were recycled in a city during the period between 1992 and 2002.
Overall, recycling rates of paper, glass and cans had an uptrend over the period, while plastic remained the least recycled material throughout the surveyed period.
At first, glass was the most recycled material at just over 18% in 1992 and it demonstrated a steady surge to over 48% in 2002. Paper followed a similar but less dramatic pattern, increasing from around 15% to around 38% in the end.
In contract, cans decreased from over 18% in 1992 to 15% in 1997, but it again raised up to over 28% in 2002.
Plastic was much lower throughout, begining at around 10% and presented a stable pattern in 1997 and 2002, at over 12%.

Quest 2:
The given graph illustrates the amount of visits to a community website during its first and second years of operation.
Overall, the figures of visits in first year tended to increase . Meanwhile, the second year of use showed a down trend.  
At the begining, in the first year, the number of visits rose steadily from July, starting at around 25,000, and reached a peak of approximately 40,000 in October. Although there was a slight decline in November and December, visits increased again to just over 40,000 in February.
After that, a downward trend was observed, with figures falling to about 15,000 in April before rising again to nearly 38,000 in June.
In contrast, the second year showed consistently lower numbers. Visits generally fluctuated between 10,000 and 20,000, peaking at around 21,000 in January. The lowest point was seen in April, at approximately 7,000 visits, followed by a modest recovery towards June.

Quest 4:
The line graph illustrates changes in the total number of four types of fish worldwide between 1982 and 2007.
Overall, Atlantic cod and yellowfin tuna showed a down trend over the period, while haddock and swordfish remained relatively stable. Among the four species, swordfish was consistently the least numerous.
At the start, Atlantic cod had the highest number, at just over 220,000 in 1982. Although it fell to around 150,000 in 1992, it rose slightly later before dropping again to about 135,000 in 2007.
By contrast, yellowfin tuna increased from about 150,000 to nearly 200,000 in 1992. After that, its number went down steadily and reached around 100,000 at the end.
Meanwhile, haddock increased slowly from about 70,000 to just over 75,000, while swordfish stayed low at around 10,000 throughout.

Quest 5:
The given graph show the mean time people in different age groups in New Zealand spent on two leisure activities per day.
Overall, time spent on reading increased with age, while listening to music showed a downward trend over the period.
At the beginning, people aged 14–24 spent the least time on reading, at about 20 minutes per day. This figure rose gradually in older groups, reaching around 35 minutes for those aged 25–32 and about 45–50 minutes among people aged 33–55. The highest amount was seen in the 56–65+ group, at roughly 70 minutes.
In contrast, listening to music showed the opposite pattern. The youngest group spent the most time, at nearly 80 minutes per day. The figure then fell to about 60 minutes in the 25–32 group and reached around 45 minutes among those aged 33–42. After that, it increased again to about 75 minutes in the oldest group.

Quest 6:
The line graph show the feelings of full-time and part-time students about the services of a university library.
Overall, satisfaction with opening hours was high, while opinions about IT support showed a downward trend among part-time students compared with full-time students.
For IT support, most full-time students were happy, with 55% very satisfied and 32% quite satisfied. Only 12% were not satisfied. In contrast, part-time students were less positive, as the largest group (45%) were not satisfied at all, while only 20% were very satisfied.
Regarding opening hours, both groups gave positive opinions. Among full-time students, almost all were satisfied, with 67% very satisfied. Similarly, most part-time students were happy, as 72% reported being very satisfied and only a small number were unhappy

quest 7:
The table compares the proportions of women in parliament and in management positions in five countries in 2000.
Overall, the figures for women in management had an uptrend, while the percentages of women in parliament showed a downward trend in five countries.
In terms of parliament, Norway ranked first, with 36% of seats held by women, followed by Canada at 28%. Much lower figures were recorded in Trinidad and Tobago (19%) and Italy (10%), while Uruguay had the lowest proportion, at just 8%.
By contrast, the percentages of women in management were higher across all countries. Italy had the highest figure, at 54%, closely followed by Norway with 52%. Canada and Uruguay both stood at 37%, whereas Trinidad and Tobago recorded 40%.

Quest 8:
The give graph compare how men and women in the UK spent time on unpaid activities in 2008, measured in minutes per day.
Overall, time spent by women on household work showed an upward trend, while men spent more time on leisure activities, which showed a higher level rather than a downward trend compared with women.
According to the table, men spent more time on TV, video and radio (137 minutes) than women (118 minutes). Time spent on reading was almost the same for both genders, at around 18–19 minutes, while men spent slightly more time on sport.
The bar chart shows clear differences in household tasks. Women spent much more time on cooking and washing, at about 75 minutes, compared with around 30 minutes for men. Women also spent more time on shopping and clothes washing, while men spent more time on repair work.

Quest 10:
The line graph shows the amount of users of fixed telephone lines and mobile phone networks in Africa during the period between 1994 and 2004.
Overall, the use of mobile phones showed a strong upward trend, while fixed telephone lines had a slow upward trend over the period.
At the begining, fixed telephone lines were used by about 1.7 people per 100, whereas mobile phones were almost unused, at around 0.06. The number of fixed-line users increased gradually, reaching just over 3 per 100 people by 2004.
By contrast, mobile phone use rose much faster. After a slow increase in the late 1990s, it grew sharply from 1999, overtook fixed lines in the early 2000s, and reached nearly 9 users per 100 people at the end of the period.

quest 11:
The line graph depicts the proportions of people working in five industries in Australia from 1962 to 2012.
Overall, employment in the service sector showed an upward trend, while the figures for manufacturing, agriculture and other industries had a downtrend over the period.
At the begining, Services was the highest workforce, started at just over 51% in 1962 and it steadily increased to 80% in 2012.
However, construction and Mining stayed extremely low, each remain below 10% during the period.
In contract, Manufacturing decreased over the 50-year period. starting with over 26% , and it continued to dropping to 10% in 2012.
Adriculture followed a similar but less pattern, falling from 10% to over 5% over the period.

Quest 12:
The bar chart illustrates the proportion of people living in urban areas in different regions of the world in 1950 and 2000, with a projection for 2030.
Overall, the proportion of urban residents showed an upward trend over time. Latin America had the highest level of urbanisation throughout the period, while Africa and Asia remained less urbanised despite significant growth.
At the beginning of the period in 1950, Latin America was the most urbanised region, with about 40% of its population living in cities. The global average stood at approximately 30%. In contrast, Africa and Asia had much lower figures, at around 10% and just over 10% respectively.
By contrast, in 2000 and 2030, the percentages increased in every region. Latin America rose to about 70% in 2000 and is expected to reach 80% in 2030. The world figure also increased to nearly 50% and is predicted to reach around 60%. Although Africa and Asia started lower, both are expected to grow to more than 50% by 2030.

Quest 13: 
The table depicts the amountof adults and children who took part in a wildlife survey in Britain fromm 2001 to 2009.
Overall, the total number of people taking part in the wildlife survey showed an upward trend, despite some small changes in the middle years. While the number of adults experienced a slight downward trend towards the end of the period.
At the beginning, in 2001, a total of 48,000 people took part in the survey. Most of them were adults, at 36,000, while only 12,000 were children. In 2003, the total number increased greatly to 248,000, mainly because adult participation rose to 212,000.
By contrast, in the later years, participation reached much higher levels. In 2005 and 2007, the total number stayed stable at just over 360,000, with adults remaining the main group. However, in 2009, the number of children increased dramatically to 270,000, equal to the number of adults, which led to the highest total figure of 540,000.

Quest 14:
The line graph depicts the cost of bananas in four countries, namely Japan, France, Germany and the USA, between 1996 and 2004.
Overall, the cost of bananas in Japan and Germany followed an upward trend , although Japan had large changes and Germany experienced a short downward trend. France remained stable, while the USA had almost no upward.
At the beginning of the period, banana costs in Japan and France were about 2 dollars per kilogram. Germany started lower, at around 1.5 dollars, while the USA had the lowest cost, at about 1 dollar. During the late 1990s, costs in Japan rose sharply, while Germany saw a slight downward trend.
By contrast, in the later years, banana costs in Japan continued to fluctuate and ended at around 2.5 dollars in 2004. Germany increased gradually to nearly 2 dollars before falling slightly. France showed small changes but stayed close to 2 dollars, whereas the cost in the USA remained almost unchanged throughout the period.

Quest 15:
The bar charts depicts the proportions of men and women aged 60–64 who were in employment in Belgium, the USA, Japan and Indonesia between 1970 and 2000.
Overall, employment rates for both men and women showed a clear downward trend in all four countries between 1970 and 2000. Despite this decline, men consistently had higher employment levels than women in both years.
At the beginning, in 1970, employment rates for men were high in every country, reaching over 80% in the USA and Indonesia. Belgium and Japan also recorded figures of around 75–80%. For women, the USA had the highest rate at nearly 80%, while Japan had the lowest at just over 50%.
By contrast, in 2000, employment levels were much lower. Male employment fell to about 50% in Belgium and around 60–75% elsewhere. Female employment decreased more sharply, particularly in Belgium, where it dropped to below 10%, while the other countries remained between roughly 45% and 60%.
