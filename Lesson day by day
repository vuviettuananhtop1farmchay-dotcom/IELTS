Many believe that the best way to ensure a happier society is to reduce the difference between in income earnings between the rich and poor
  I agree.Because if making the gap between rich and poor smaller, it can help people feel happier, feels fairer and less stressful.
 When everyone has a more equal income, people feel more happy and can help each other. because everyone is equal, there 's no war, so people 
 can live longer and happier. However, happiness also comes from things like good health,freedom and education.
 So, income equality is helpful, but it is not the only factor that makes all of us happy.
