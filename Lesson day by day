1.what is this?
  It stands for:
        clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
  it is a gene-editing technology that allows scientist to:
          precisely cut DNA
          remove or disable genes, or 
          insert new genetic information 
origin: 
It was discovered in bacteria , which use it as a natural defense system to protect themselves from viruses. Scientist adapted this system into a powerful tool for editing genes in plants animals and humans

8/12 : we live in a simulation theory
1.what is this?
      it suggest that everything we see touch, feel , and experience might not be the "real world", but a computer -generated simulation created by an advanced civilization 
   this idea isn't new.many philosophers throughout history have asked similar questions

1.ancient roots of the idea 
 plato- allegory of the cave : 
       -people live chained inside a cave
       - they only see shadows on a wall
       - they believed the shadow are reality 
       - in truth, the shadows are just projections from objects behind them

15/12: Gender roles
 1.what is this?
   it referes to the social constructed expectations about how indivisuals should behave, think, and act based on their gender

5/1: HISTORY
  ACIENT EGYPT - stability through control 
acient egypt, one of the first long-lasting civilizations
egypt's power came from geography, 
Many believe that the best way to ensure a happier society is to reduce the difference between in income earnings between the rich and poor
  I agree.Because if making the gap between rich and poor smaller, it can help people feel happier, feels fairer and less stressful.
 When everyone has a more equal income, people feel more happy and can help each other. because everyone is equal, there 's no war, so people 
 can live longer and happier. However, happiness also comes from things like good health,freedom and education.
 So, income equality is helpful, but it is not the only factor that makes all of us happy.

12/1: 
people shoould plant more trees in open spaces in towns and cities
-> open spaces in towns and cities should be decorated with more trees
because trees clean the air -> cleaning the air is considered to be main reason
for example, TB has more trees than HN -> HN is seen to have fewer trees than TB
So TB has fresher air than HN ->  fresher air is enjoyed by TB people

Many poeple believe that open spaces in towns and cities should be decorated with more trees along the streets.
As a matter of fact, cleaning the air is considered to be main reason why trees are so valuable. for example, HN is seen to have fewer trees than TB.
fresher air is enjoyed by TB people.

It is bad for people to put their personal infromation online for purposes such as signing up for social networks or online banking
->  personal information is bad to be put on syber space for purposes such as registering for social networks or online banking
->  personal information should not be put ........
Because it is not safe
-> security is not outdated/ defended/ advanced enough 
so personal information can be used for bad purposes
->  so personal information would/ can be put in danger/ stolen/ attacked/ leaked/ breached 
for example , we can lose a lot of money because hacker can steal our information and take our money from the bank
->  money from the bank can be hacked as our private data can be stolen by hackers/ threat actors
so we should not put our personal information online
-> the internet/cyber space is not a ladnscape our personal information should be made available. 

LESSON: CYBER FINANCIAL CRIME 
it is one of the fastest growing threats in vn and around the world.
this lesson explain the current situation, tool used by hackers, recent incidents, and the reasons behind rising cybercrime

1.the current cyber landscape in vn
VN is experiencing a rapid digital tranformation

15/1: 
doan 4: USE TO erope
startled by the bright silken banners -> run in public
Yet, within decades Chinese silks were widely worn <-- the rich and noble families of Rome.
The Roman Emperor Heliogabalus (218-222 AD) wore nothing but silk : romane emperor
which was oneconfined to the nobility, has now spread to all classes without distinction --> everyone has silk
The desire for silk
war -> roman soldier scared of white banners -> fled                  <----
-> decades , emperor wore silk -> rich ppl -> everyone -> desire for silk/ \

doan 5 : 
silk production -> korea
cultivation of the silkworm --> india

doan 6 : silk go to middle east
-->two monks : high silkworm egg in bamboo walking sticks
-->started to make silk -->  church and state monopol --> cheaper normal silk than chines 
undercutting : cheaper than price
. But higher quality still expensive in the west  --> persian --> italy --> all europe

doan 7: 
world production *2. china * japan--> 1970, only china

NEW WORLD
undercut a market = sell at a lower  price 
 approximately = a lower or a bit 
fled = run away 
panic = fear


LESSON: 
1. would i let my kids run around the neighborhood unsupervised? : don't care
2. would i trust the education system wholeheartedly? 
3. would i tell my kids that hard works guarantees a stable life?
4.would i let my kid develop common sense with friends - or force traditional common sense early?
                             (the sun is yellow)
core philosophy : main idea
roam = run 
SHOULD THE SCHOOL TEACH CHILRDEN PRATICAL SKILLS OR JUST ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE?
  Schools should also teach practical skills such as money management, communication, and basic life skills for daily living.
  Practical skills help students become independent and confident in real-life situations.
  Learning both academic and practical skills helps students be better prepared for future jobs.
  Therefore, schools should teach both academic knowledge and practical skills to give students a balanced education.

19/1 : history of high tech

TEST 2: The Clipper Races: an era of competition between cargo ships
------During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the British East India Company had the monopoly on trade with China and India. This meant that because no rival could legally import tea or other goods from these countries at this time, the company was rarely in a hurry to transport its merchandise. Instead, its priority was to minimise costs by carrying as much as possible on each ship. This meant that its ships - known as East lndiamen - were enormous, strong and very slow.
     (East india company :monopoly: china and india-> no rival-> no need to be fast-> minimize cost )
------By 1800, the average East lndiaman could carry 1,200 tons of merchandise. The trading pattern for China tea usually meant the East lndiamen set sail from Britain in January, sailed round the Cape of Good Hope at the southernmost tip of Africa, and arrived in China in September. There they would load up that year's tea harvest, set off again and, depending on the wind and weather, aim to arrive back by the following September. So even with favourable sailing conditions, the round trip lasted almost two years, and if anything went wrong it could take a lot longer.
      trip 2 Years : jan:britain-> sep:china->next sep:britain(wind and weather) 
------However, by 1834 the company had lost its trading monopolies, and tea had become a freely traded item. Having no more use for its great ships, the company sold them off, and many were bought by merchants or their captains, who continued to plough the seas between Britain and China. But now that tea could be traded freely, a few smart sailors began to realise that whoever brought each new harvest of tea to Britain first, stood to make the most money.
      loss of monopoly-> EIC sold big ships-> captain + merchans-> fast->
------This was partly because if you were home first, you could sell your shipment of tea before your competitors even arrived, and partly because consumers in Britain in the nineteenth century believed that the fresher and earlier-picked the tea, the better the resulting drink. Tea traders now needed faster, sleeker ships to bring their precious cargo back. Nevertheless, in Britain this idea only caught on slowly, and while the 1840s saw a few faster ships launched, for the time being many merchants remained satisfied with the slow but reliable East lndiamen.
      opportunities<- british though that earlier picked/ fresher tea=better drink-> faster. But idea caught on slow-> still use EIC
------In fact it was the Americans who pioneered the first clipper ships. These vessels were fast and slender, with a narrow hull that was deeper at the back than at the front and masses of sails on tall masts. They earned their name from the way that they clipped off journey times British merchants resolved to build their own clippers to rival the Americans and the first British tea clipper, Stornaway, was built in Aberdeen in 1850 More tea clippers were designed and built in Britain throughout the 1850s and 1860s, they had a narrower beam than their American equivalents, making them less powerful during storms, but faster in calmer weather.
       clipper: smaller ships…..:in America-> britain( stornaway); less power in storm , faster in calm
------There was a great spirit of competition between the British and American ships plying the tea trade, but to begin with the Americans had the edge. Then in 1851 a British ship owner, Richard Green, built the aptly named clipper Challenger, with the stated intention of beating the American ships. Loaded with tea, Challenger left China for London in 1852 at the same time as the American clipper Challenge, a much larger, older ship, already greatly admired for its speed. Large sums were bet on which would complete the journey first. In the event, the British ship beat its rival to London by two days, amid much jubilation. From then on, such international races grew in popularity.
       competition: at the beginning American-> bristish : challenger-> challenger vs challenge ->( older larger)-> challenger : 2 days
 ------After 1855, American participation in the British tea trade gradually stopped. But even without the Anglo-American rivalry, the competitive spirit continued. It was really ignited when new ports were opened up for trade in China. These included Fouchow, which was much closer to the tea-producing areas than Canton, the port used previously. As a result, tea could be loaded onboard earlier and fresher, and the clippers could set off in late May or early June - sometimes not even taking time to fill out the official paperwork - racing back to Britain whatever the difficulties.
       after 1855< no more American-> competition still continue-> new port Fouchou( old port: caunton)-. Load faster and fresher( smtime no official paper work)
 -------They sped down through the South China Sea and into the Indian Ocean, then raced to get round the southernmost tip of Africa at the Cape of Good Hope. Then it was north across the vast Atlantic, past the Azores, through the English Channel and into the estuary of the River Thames. Once there, they would be towed by tugs, up the river and into the docks.
       New group: south china sea-> oidian ocean->cape of good hope ( Africa)-> atlantic-> river thames-. Town by tugs into ducksNew group: south china sea-> oidian ocean->cape of good hope ( Africa)-> atlantic-> river thames-. Town by tugs into ducks
 -------The cargo of the winning ship could earn a premium of up to sixpence per pound-and so the captain and crew were rewarded by the owners of the cargo. But the races were about more than just money the crews, about 40 men on each clipper, were expert sailors, proud of their ships, and they delighted in competing against each other. Without their enthusiasm, the races would never have happened, since getting the ship home as fast as possible required the crew to be totally dedicated and to sacrifice much of their rest for the duration of the race. 
        cargo of winning ship: sixpence per pound, > competition was more than just money
